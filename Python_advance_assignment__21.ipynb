        "\n",
        "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of all possible outcomes of a random variable in a given experiment or event. It is used to model the probabilities of various outcomes of a random process or event. Probability distributions can be continuous or discrete, and they can be represented using probability density functions or cumulative distribution functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the values in a probability distribution are random, we can still make predictions about their likelihood based on the probability distribution function. For example, if we have a fair six-sided die, the probability distribution for rolling any particular number is 1/6, or approximately 0.167. While we can't predict the exact outcome of rolling the die, we can predict the likelihood of each possible outcome based on the probability distribution.\n",
