        "\n",
        "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure code such that it is more modular, reusable, and maintainable. OOP is based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. OOP allows developers to create complex software systems by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. By creating classes, developers can define reusable code that can be used to create multiple instances of the same object. OOP also supports concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, which allow developers to reuse code and create more flexible and extensible systems."

        "\n",
        "When an attribute is called on an object in Python, the interpreter first looks for the attribute in the object's class. If the attribute is not found in the class, the interpreter searches in the parent classes in the order specified by the method resolution order (MRO). This is known as the inheritance search order. If the attribute is still not found in the parent classes, the interpreter will continue the search in the parent's parent classes, and so on, until it reaches the top of the inheritance tree (i.e., the root object class). If the attribute is not found in any of the classes, a `AttributeError` is raised."

This allows the method to access and modify the attributes of the specific instance that calls it. When a method is called using the dot notation, such as `instance.method()`, the instance is automatically passed as the first argument."

        "In other words, the `__init__` method is used to define the initial state of an object, which is determined by the values passed as arguments to the method when the object is created. It can take arguments like any other method in the class, but the first argument is always `self`, which represents the instance of the class that is being initialized. \n",
